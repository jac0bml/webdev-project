	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>Hello, my name is Jacob Landstrom, and I am a Computer Science student at Portland State University. I am minoring in Business Administration
		and have a few more terms left before graduating (expected graduation: June 2023). The usefulness of Computer Science is endless, and with
		information on business, management, marketing, and more, there are plenty of different opportunities in the future.
	</p>
	<p>
		In my free time, you can find me learning and doing new things, even if not Computer Science related. This includes things such as art: drawing,
		painting, and more. I have been learning new programming languages and frameworks recently, including Laravel (PHP) and general web components
		(which can be used in many different frameworks). I’ve also been digging deeper into Java (including Android apps) and Go.

	<h2>Projects & Art</h2>
	<h3>Snake Game</h3>
	<p>Built a Snake Game in CS-162 in Winter 2022 at Clackamas Community College.</p>
	<p>This game utilized the C++ programming language for the app, and a web server (Nginx) running PHP and MySQL to store and handle the game data for the leaderboard.
		The game has been online since then and is still fully functional. Feel free to give it a try on Windows.</p>

	<h3>Lynk The Lion</h3>
	<p>Lynk the Lion was built out of recycled electronics and is on display at my high school. After seeing lots of electronics and other related items be considered too obsolete,
		the concept was born of displaying different pieces of technology in a way which allows people to see it in a new light. This encourages repurposing and reusing before
		recycling or throwing away.</p>
	<p>Eventually, an old functional laptop was placed below the lion which would periodically (or on command) play different lion sounds.</p>
