				<p>Hello, my name is Jacob Landstrom, and I am a Computer Science student at Portland State University. I am minoring in Business Administration
					and have a few more terms left before graduating (expected graduation: June 2023). The usefulness of Computer Science is endless, and with
					information on business, management, marketing, and more, there are plenty of different opportunities in the future.
				</p>
				<p>
					In my free time, you can find me learning and doing new things, even if not Computer Science related. This includes things such as art: drawing,
					painting, and more. I have been learning new programming languages and frameworks recently, including Laravel (PHP) and general web components
					(which can be used in many different frameworks). I’ve also been digging deeper into Java (including Android apps) and Go.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Continue on throughout the site to learn more about me!</b>

	<h3>Snake Game</h3>
	<div class="col-lg-12">

			<div class="col-sm-10">
				<p>Built a Snake Game in CS-162 in Winter 2022 at <a href="https://www.clackamas.edu/" target="_blank">Clackamas Community College</a>.</p>
				<p>This game utilized the C++ programming language for the app, and a web server (Nginx) running PHP and MySQL to store and handle the game data for the
					leaderboard.
					The game has been online since then and is still fully functional. Feel free to <a href="assets/Snake-Game.exe" target="_blank">give it a try on Windows</a>.

		<h3>Lynk The Lion</h3>
		<div class="col-lg-12">
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-10">
					<p>
						Lynk the Lion was built out of recycled electronics and is on display at my high school. After seeing lots of electronics and other related items be
						considered too obsolete,
						the concept was born of displaying different pieces of technology in a way which allows people to see it in a new light. This encourages repurposing and
						reusing before
						recycling or throwing away.
					</p>
					<p>Eventually, an old functional laptop was placed below the lion which would periodically (or on command) play different lion sounds.</p>

		<h3>Pet Painting</h3>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-10">
					<p>
						In high school, I was tasked with painting a pet portrait for one of my art classes. I used different blending and layering techniques to give the painting
						more texture. Layering at first was a challenge, but eventually everything came together. My dog currently has cancer, and this painting will be a nice way
						to remember all the memories with her.
